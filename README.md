**Quadtree Image Compressor**

This project implements an image compression algorithm using the quadtree data structure in C.

The quadtree image compressor is an algorithm that compresses images by dividing them into
quadrants recursively until each quadrant contains a uniform color. 
This technique effectively reduces the size of images while maintaining a balance 
between image quality and compression ratio.
